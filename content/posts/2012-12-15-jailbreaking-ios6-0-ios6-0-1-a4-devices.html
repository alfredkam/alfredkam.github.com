<p>Note :: Only works for A4 devices eg - iPhone 4<br />
Note :: This is a tethered jailbreak</p>
<p>1) Upgrade to iOS 6.0 / 6.0.1<br />
2) Download the newest redsn0w<br />
3) Download the 6.0 ipsw (the file name should be ~ iPhone3,1_6.0_10A403_Restore.ipsw)<br />
4) open Redsn0w<br />
5) click extra<br />
6) select ipsw -> use the 6.0 ipsw<br />
     --if you dont use this 6.0 ipsw, redsn0w will prompt install error)<br />
7) hit back<br />
8) follow on screen instructions for jailbreak<br />
9) go to extra again -> select ipsw (use the 6.0 ipsw)<br />
10) just boot</p>

<p>if cydia does not show up<br />

Use the AutoInstall folder: If you don't have iFile on your device, you can use a desktop application such as iExplorer, DiskAid, or Phone Disk to access the device's filesystem and install Cydia. First open the application and navigate to (or create, if necessary) this directory: /var/root/Media/Cydia/AutoInstall - and then download the following file and put it in that directory: http://apt.saurik.com/debs/cydia_1.1.8_iphoneos-arm.deb. Reboot your device with the redsn0w just boot option, and Cydia should be installed.</p>

<p>if the repo for apt.saurik.com is empty and missing com.saurik.substrate.safemode (most tweaks depends on this)<br />
12)<br />
Download: http://apt.saurik.com/debs/com.saurik.substrate.safemode_0.9.3999_iphoneos-arm.deb<br />
put it in the AutoInstall folder and reboot using the redsn0w just boot option</p>
<p>13) open cydia app again, the source should start downloading and substrate safemode should be installed.</p>
