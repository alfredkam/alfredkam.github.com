Use the AutoInstall folder: If you don't have iFile on your device, you can use a desktop application such as iExplorer, DiskAid, or Phone Disk to access the device's filesystem and install Cydia. First open the application and navigate to (or create, if necessary) this directory: /var/root/Media/Cydia/AutoInstall - and then download the following file and put it in that directory: http://apt.saurik.com/debs/cydia_1.1.8_iphoneos-arm.deb. Reboot your device with the redsn0w just boot option, and Cydia should be installed.</p>

<p>if the repo for apt.saurik.com is empty and missing com.saurik.substrate.safemode (most tweaks depends on this)<br />

Download: http://apt.saurik.com/debs/com.saurik.substrate.safemode_0.9.3999_iphoneos-arm.deb<br />
put it in the AutoInstall folder and reboot using the redsn0w just boot option</p>
<p>13) open cydia app again, the source should start downloading and substrate safemode should be installed.</p>
