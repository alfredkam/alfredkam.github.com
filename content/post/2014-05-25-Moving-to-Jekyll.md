<p>Alright I'm a hacker and lazy to work myself around Wordpress - which is in php & dynamic content.  Now recently migrated into Jekyll and use github to serve my pages - free CDN and fast static content! Woohoo</p>

<p>I will be re-building the site from scratch, so beware for the next couple of weeks</p>
